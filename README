BiasedDelay AU Plugin
=====================

A basic delay effect with sample bias modulation. This can produce great 
nonlinear saturation effects, however its behaviour is highly dependent on 
the audio source.
 
TODO:
* clear buffer tail when shortening delay time
  * OR: always write to full buffer, but stretch it (and adjust write speed)
* better dry/wet mixing method (don't just fade over)
